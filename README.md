Read MBR - GPT info

To run this script you must chmod 755 mbrInfo.sh and just type ./mbrInfo.sh
You must run it under root privileges. The two files (partitionTypesGUID,
partition_types) must also be lying on the same folder where mbrInfo.sh is.
bc has to be installed, which in most cases it is already there.
This is a very simple script that READS MBR - GPT information from a hard 
disk or DD file. The output gives you some information about the MBR - GPT
structure. It works on most known partition types exept a few ones.
Because this is still under development, bugs may be there. Please
fill free to give a notice.
USE THIS SCRIPT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!Although this script
is NOT distructive in any way. It reads info,that just
sit's already there(thats why it's always good idea to
download software from original distributors). Authors
are not responsible for any missuse or any damage that
might happen. Have fun !!
