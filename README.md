Read MBR - GPT info

To run this script you must chmod 755 mbrInfo and just type ./mbrInfo
You must run it under root privileges. The two files (partitionTypesGUID,
partition_types) must also be lye on the same folder where mbrInfo is
This is a very simple script that reads MBR - GPT info from any device
or DD file. The output gives you some information about the MBR - GPT
structure. It works on most known partition types exept a few ones.
Because this is still under development, bugs may be there. Please
