Read hard disk MBR - GPT info
-----------------------------
This is a very simple script that READS MBR - GPT information from a hard
disk or DD file. The output gives you some information about the MBR - GPT
structure. It works on most known partition types exept a few ones.
ie.
Hard disk signature is: 0009C532
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Partition:1 /dev/sda1 80 20 21 00 83 fe ff ff  00 08 00 00 00 00 c0 04 is bootable 80
Partition size in Hex value is = 0x04C00000 -- in Dec value is = 79691776 -- size: 38.000 GB
start sector: 2048 , end sector: 79693823 ID: 83  Linux
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Partition:2 /dev/sda2 00 fe ff ff 82 fe ff ff  00 08 c0 04 00 00 40 00 is not bootable 00
Partition size in Hex value is = 0x00400000 -- in Dec value is = 4194304 -- size: 2.000 GB
start sector: 79693824 , end sector: 83888127 ID: 82  Linux swap / So

Information on starting ending sector, size, partition type disk signature etc.

To run this script you must chmod 755 mbrInfo.sh and just type ./mbrInfo.sh
You must run it under root privileges. The two files (partitionTypesGUID,
partition types) must also be lying on the same folder where mbrInfo.sh is.
bc has to be installed, which in most cases it is already there.
Just run ./mbrInfo.sh then you will have to enter a device of file to scan
ie. /dev/sda and press enter

Because this is still under development, bugs may be there. Please
